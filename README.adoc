= Explanation

This project contains a multimodule gradle project that wants a `NoHttp` checkstyle rule to be added.

The first commit uses gradle version `4.10.2` and can run the basic `checkstyle` check by running

    ./gradlew clean check

The second commit adds `NoHttp` and breaks, can be run with:

    ./gradlew clean check --stacktrace

Last commit is the result of upgrading to gradle 5 with the following command:

    ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 5.4.1

And then
    ./gradlew clean check --stacktrace
